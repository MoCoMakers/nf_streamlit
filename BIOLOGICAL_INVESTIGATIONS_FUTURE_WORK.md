# Biological Data Warehouse Investigations & Future Work

## ðŸ§¬ **Overview**

This document outlines advanced biological investigations and future work opportunities enabled by the DepMap data warehouse and AI-supported analytical capabilities. These investigations leverage the full power of the `run-query` tool and advanced SQL features to explore complex biological relationships in drug response data.

## ðŸŽ¯ **AI-Supported Biological Concepts**

### **1. Drug Response Pattern Hierarchies**

#### **Concept**: Recursive Drug Sensitivity Networks
**AI-Supported Approach**: Use recursive CTEs to model how drug sensitivity patterns propagate through biological networks.

```sql
-- Drug sensitivity pattern hierarchy
WITH RECURSIVE drug_hierarchy AS (
    -- Base: Most sensitive drugs (primary targets)
    SELECT name, delta_s_prime, tissue, moa, 1 as level
    FROM fnl_sprime_pooled_delta_sprime 
    WHERE sensitivity = 'Sensitive' AND delta_s_prime < -1.5
    
    UNION ALL
    
    -- Recursive: Find drugs with similar MOA or tissue patterns
    SELECT d.name, d.delta_s_prime, d.tissue, d.moa, dh.level + 1
    FROM drug_hierarchy dh
    JOIN fnl_sprime_pooled_delta_sprime d ON (
        (dh.moa = d.moa AND dh.tissue = d.tissue) OR  -- Same MOA and tissue
        (dh.moa = d.moa AND d.delta_s_prime < -1.0)   -- Same MOA, different tissue
    )
    WHERE dh.level < 4 AND d.name != dh.name AND d.sensitivity = 'Sensitive'
)
SELECT * FROM drug_hierarchy ORDER BY level, delta_s_prime;
```

**Biological Hypothesis**: Drugs with similar mechanisms of action form hierarchical networks where primary sensitive drugs can predict secondary drug responses.

**AI Applications**:
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Model drug-drug interaction networks
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Identify drug response pattern clusters
- **Predictive Modeling**: Predict drug sensitivity based on hierarchical position

### **2. Cross-Tissue Drug Response Analysis**

#### **Concept**: Pan-Tissue vs. Tissue-Specific Drug Effects
**AI-Supported Approach**: Use window functions to analyze drug effectiveness across tissue types.

```sql
-- Cross-tissue drug effectiveness analysis
SELECT tissue, name, delta_s_prime,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY tissue ORDER BY delta_s_prime) as tissue_rank,
       PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY tissue ORDER BY delta_s_prime) as percentile,
       AVG(delta_s_prime) OVER (PARTITION BY tissue) as tissue_avg,
       STDDEV(delta_s_prime) OVER (PARTITION BY tissue) as tissue_stddev,
       COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY name) as tissue_count
FROM fnl_sprime_pooled_delta_sprime 
WHERE tissue IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY tissue, delta_s_prime DESC;
```

**Biological Hypothesis**: Some drugs show consistent effectiveness across tissues (pan-tissue), while others are highly tissue-specific.

**AI Applications**:
- **Multi-task Learning**: Predict drug response across multiple tissue types
- **Transfer Learning**: Use pan-tissue drugs to predict tissue-specific responses
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combine tissue-specific models for better predictions

### **3. Drug-Gene Interaction Networks**

#### **Concept**: Comprehensive Drug-Gene Interaction Matrix
**AI-Supported Approach**: Use FULL OUTER JOINs to create complete interaction matrices.

```sql
-- Comprehensive drug-gene interaction matrix
SELECT d.name as drug_name, g.name as gene_name, d.delta_s_prime, d.sensitivity,
       d.ref_pooled_s_prime, d.test_pooled_ec50, d.p_val_median_man_whit,
       CASE 
           WHEN d.delta_s_prime < -0.5 THEN 'Highly Sensitive'
           WHEN d.delta_s_prime < 0 THEN 'Sensitive'
           WHEN d.delta_s_prime < 0.5 THEN 'Resistant'
           ELSE 'Highly Resistant'
       END as response_category
FROM fnl_sprime_pooled_delta_sprime d
FULL OUTER JOIN im_omics_genes g ON d.gene_id = g.id
WHERE d.delta_s_prime IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY ABS(d.delta_s_prime) DESC;
```

**Biological Hypothesis**: Drug-gene interactions form complex networks that can be used to predict drug response and identify novel therapeutic targets.

**AI Applications**:
- **Matrix Factorization**: Decompose drug-gene interaction matrices
- **Network Analysis**: Identify key genes in drug response networks
- **Recommendation Systems**: Suggest drugs based on gene mutation profiles

### **4. Mechanism of Action Clustering**

#### **Concept**: MOA-Based Drug Effectiveness Patterns
**AI-Supported Approach**: Use advanced aggregations to analyze drug mechanisms.

```sql
-- MOA effectiveness analysis with statistical measures
SELECT moa, 
       COUNT(*) as drug_count,
       AVG(delta_s_prime) as avg_delta_s_prime,
       STDDEV(delta_s_prime) as stddev_delta_s_prime,
       MIN(delta_s_prime) as min_delta_s_prime,
       MAX(delta_s_prime) as max_delta_s_prime,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN sensitivity = 'Sensitive' THEN 1 END) as sensitive_count,
       ROUND(100.0 * COUNT(CASE WHEN sensitivity = 'Sensitive' THEN 1 END) / COUNT(*), 2) as sensitivity_rate,
       -- Statistical significance of MOA effectiveness
       CASE 
           WHEN AVG(delta_s_prime) < -0.5 THEN 'Highly Effective'
           WHEN AVG(delta_s_prime) < 0 THEN 'Effective'
           WHEN AVG(delta_s_prime) < 0.5 THEN 'Moderately Effective'
           ELSE 'Ineffective'
       END as moa_effectiveness
FROM fnl_sprime_pooled_delta_sprime 
WHERE moa IS NOT NULL AND moa != ''
GROUP BY moa
HAVING COUNT(*) > 3
ORDER BY avg_delta_s_prime ASC;
```

**Biological Hypothesis**: Different mechanisms of action show distinct patterns of effectiveness across genes and tissues.

**AI Applications**:
- **Clustering Analysis**: Group drugs by similar MOA patterns
- **Classification Models**: Predict drug effectiveness based on MOA
- **Feature Engineering**: Use MOA as features in drug response prediction

## ðŸ”¬ **Advanced Biological Investigations**

### **1. Drug Resistance Mechanisms**

#### **Investigation**: Identify patterns in drug resistance
```sql
-- Drug resistance pattern analysis
WITH resistance_analysis AS (
    SELECT name, gene_id, tissue, delta_s_prime, sensitivity,
           ref_pooled_s_prime, test_pooled_s_prime,
           (test_pooled_s_prime - ref_pooled_s_prime) as resistance_magnitude
    FROM fnl_sprime_pooled_delta_sprime 
    WHERE sensitivity = 'Resistant' AND delta_s_prime > 0.5
)
SELECT gene_id, tissue,
       COUNT(*) as resistant_drug_count,
       AVG(resistance_magnitude) as avg_resistance,
       STRING_AGG(DISTINCT name, ', ') as resistant_drugs
FROM resistance_analysis
GROUP BY gene_id, tissue
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY avg_resistance DESC;
```

**Biological Question**: What genetic and tissue factors contribute to drug resistance?

### **2. Tissue-Specific Drug Discovery**

#### **Investigation**: Identify tissue-specific drug targets
```sql
-- Tissue-specific drug effectiveness
WITH tissue_specificity AS (
    SELECT name, tissue, delta_s_prime,
           COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY name) as tissue_count,
           AVG(delta_s_prime) OVER (PARTITION BY name) as overall_effectiveness,
           delta_s_prime - AVG(delta_s_prime) OVER (PARTITION BY name) as tissue_specificity
    FROM fnl_sprime_pooled_delta_sprime 
    WHERE sensitivity = 'Sensitive'
)
SELECT name, tissue, delta_s_prime, tissue_specificity,
       CASE 
           WHEN tissue_specificity < -0.5 THEN 'Highly Tissue-Specific'
           WHEN tissue_specificity < -0.2 THEN 'Tissue-Specific'
           ELSE 'Pan-Tissue'
       END as specificity_category
FROM tissue_specificity
WHERE tissue_count > 1
ORDER BY ABS(tissue_specificity) DESC;
```

**Biological Question**: Which drugs show strong tissue-specific effects that could be leveraged for targeted therapy?

### **3. Gene-Drug Synergy Networks**

#### **Investigation**: Identify synergistic drug combinations
```sql
-- Gene-drug synergy analysis
WITH drug_pairs AS (
    SELECT d1.name as drug1, d2.name as drug2, d1.gene_id, d1.tissue,
           d1.delta_s_prime as delta1, d2.delta_s_prime as delta2,
           (d1.delta_s_prime + d2.delta_s_prime) as combined_effect
    FROM fnl_sprime_pooled_delta_sprime d1
    JOIN fnl_sprime_pooled_delta_sprime d2 ON d1.gene_id = d2.gene_id AND d1.tissue = d2.tissue
    WHERE d1.name < d2.name  -- Avoid duplicates
      AND d1.sensitivity = 'Sensitive' AND d2.sensitivity = 'Sensitive'
)
SELECT drug1, drug2, gene_id, tissue, delta1, delta2, combined_effect,
       CASE 
           WHEN combined_effect < -1.0 THEN 'Potential Synergy'
           WHEN combined_effect < -0.5 THEN 'Additive Effect'
           ELSE 'No Synergy'
       END as synergy_category
FROM drug_pairs
WHERE combined_effect < -0.5
ORDER BY combined_effect ASC;
```

**Biological Question**: Which drug combinations show synergistic effects for specific genes and tissues?
